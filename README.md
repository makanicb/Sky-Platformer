Building the Game: Skybound is designed to be run in a WebGL environment. To build the game, first navigate to the Assets/Scenes/Final Build folder in the Unity Editor. The scenes in this folder are the ones meant to be built for the game. In the Editor, open the Build Settings and make sure that WebGL is the target platform. From there, add all the scenes in the Final Build folder to the build. Make sure that the scene that is opened when the game is run is the MainMenu scene. From there, do a clean build of the game. From their, the game can be launched using the "build and run" option in the unity editor, or by uploading the game to an online host such as itch.io or GitHub (instructions vary).
