Building the Game: Skybound is designed to be run in a WebGL environment. To build the game, first navigate to the Assets/Scenes/BetaBuild folder in the Unity Editor. The scenes in this folder are the ones meant to be built for the game. In the Editor, open the Build Settings and make sure that WebGL is the target platform. From there, add all the scenes in the BetaBuild folder to the build. Make sure that the scene that is opened when the game is run is the MainMenu scene. From there, press the Build and Run button. Once the game is built, it will be opened in your default Web Browser.
